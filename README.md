This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a very simple project that implements the Guess Who boardgame with a pokemon theme using React and Firebase.

How to run it:

$ git clone https://github.com/JsBatista/GuessWhoPokemon.git
$ cd guesswho
$ npm i
$ npm start

You MUST play it with a friend with voice connection on other app to a better experience

How to Play It:

 - Create a Room and tell your friend to enter the room you created
 - Each one will receive a secret pokemon and a table below
 - Your pokemon is secret! Dont tell who is your pokemon!
 - The two players will take turns asking YES or NO questions to their oponents.
 - You can eliminate a pokemon on the board by clicking on it. To undo this, just click on it again
 - When you are certain on which is your oponent pokemon, select one on the select and press GUESS
 - BEWARE! You can only make one guess. If you guess it wrong, you lose the game!
 - Have Fun :)
